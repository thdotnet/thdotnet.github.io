It's been a while since the last time I've created a new blog post. There are many reasons, but the truth is that things change so fast in the Azure/Cloud world, that all the effort to compose ideas that will generate a new post, doesn't seem to worth. 

At the same time, many times I've googled about a particular issue on Azure, and guess what, I've found my own answer / blog post from the past. I'll try again and hopefully it will help you to solve your problems or give you insights about new possibilities using Microsoft Azure.

Welcome, and feel free to send a tweet @thdotnet
